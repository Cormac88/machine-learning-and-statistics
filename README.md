## Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook

1. Python and jupyter lab are needed to run the `.ipnb` files in this repository.

2. Download `Python` from https://www.python.org/.

3. If you use `conda`, type `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`. If you use `pip`, type `pip install jupyterlab` and press enter.

4. Wait for jupyter to finish installing.

Please see the [official Installation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) of Jupyter Lab page if you are having issues.

# Running the Code

1. Change directory to the folder that contains the.ipynb file you wish to run.

2. Type `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.

3. Jupyter lab will open in your browser as a new tab. Keep the command prompt window open as it needs to stay running while Jupyter Notebook is active.

4. Click on the `.ipynb` file you wish to run.

5. Click on `Kernel` and then select `Restart Kernal and Run All Cells`.

6. When finished, close the tab in your browser and then press press 'ctrl + C' in the command prompt to end the session.
